										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following the death of Paul O’Grady, Battersea Dogs and Cats Home has seen donations pass £100,000.</p>
<p>Battersea said it has been “overwhelmed and touched” by the public’s generosity in donating to its “tribute fund”.</p>
<p>O’Grady, who became an ambassador for Battersea in 2012 after the success of ITV’s multi-award-winning For The Love of Dogs, died unexpectedly on Tuesday (28 March) at the age of 67.</p>
<p>Peter Laurie, chief executive of the charity, said in a statement to the PA news agency: “Over the coming weeks and months, Battersea will be finding the best way to pay tribute to our wonderful friend and ambassador, the late, great Paul O’Grady MBE.</p>
<p>“We have been overwhelmed and touched by the countless letters, calls, emails and messages of support along with the generous donations made by kind members of the public this week.</p>
<p>“We will be looking to find a suitably fitting way to remember the profound impact Paul had at Battersea and the rescue animal sector, something that will support the animals that Paul loved so much and that would make him proud.”</p>
<p>O’Grady was given a special recognition award at the 2018 National Television Awards for the impact For The Love Of Dogs had on helping find homes for rescue animals nationwide.</p>
<p>He was also recognised with an RSPCA animal hero award for his contribution to animal welfare.</p>
<p>Last year, the late comedian was joined by the Queen Consort in a one-off episode of the show to mark 160 years of Battersea.</p>
<p>Camilla shared her sympathies with O’Grady’s family privately, Buckingham Palace said in statement.</p>
<p>The royal family’s Twitter account paid tribute with a photograph of Camilla walking beside him. The statement read: “Deeply saddened to hear of the death of Paul O’Grady, who worked closely with Her Majesty in support of Battersea, providing lots of laughter and many waggy-tailed memories.”</p>
<p>Other animal rescue charities and organisations also paid tribute to the star, who was known for his drag alter ego, Lily Savage.</p>
<p>Chris Sherwood, chief executive of the RSPCA, said that the actor’s “love for animals and the incredible way he told their stories inspired countless families to re-home rescue pet”, while Owen Sharp, chief executive of Dogs Trust, added that O’Grady was “a devoted dog love, which shone through his charity work and his television shows”.</p>
<p>During the first series of For The Love of Dogs, O’Grady rehomed Eddie, a Chihuahua-Jack Russell cross puppy, at his Kent farmhouse.</p>
<p>He also adopted Boycie, a shih-tzu, in 2014, Conchita, a Maltese, in 2015, Arfur, a mongrel puppy, in 2017, Nancy, another mongrel puppy, in 2020, and Sausage, a wire-haired dachshund, in 2021.</p>
<p>In tribute to the late comedian and TV star, O’Grady’s final radio show will be rebroadcast on Easter Sunday, after it originally aired on Boom Radio on Christmas Day last year.</p>
<p>BBC One will air a past episode of game show Blankety Blank on Saturday night, which features O’Grady as Lily Savage.</p>

<p>KUALA LUMPUR — Malaysian social media star Siew Pui Yi is now venturing into the education sector.</p>
<p>Through an Instagram post on Feb 14, Ms Siew announced that she is offering US$1 million (S$1.3 million) worth of scholarships to underprivileged students.</p>
<p>According to Ms Siew, also known as ms_puiyi on Instagram, this is one of her ways to give back to society as she understands that not everyone is handed equal opportunities when it comes to education.</p>
<p>She revealed that she initially wanted to study medicine but could not pursue her dream of becoming a surgeon. This was due to various factors such as financial constraints as she came from an underprivileged family.</p>
<p>She also shared that she ended up pursuing a degree in business while having to work part-time as a model.</p>
<p>“This has always been something that I wish to hopefully make a difference some day, to give equal opportunities to deserving students that can’t afford the education they need to succeed.</p>
<p>“And now, I am pleased to announce that I will be launching my very own scholarship to help students achieve their dreams,” said the 24-year-old.</p>
<p>Through her partnership with Educapital Foundation, scholarships will be offered to underprivileged students from all over the world including Malaysia.</p>
<p>“Each student will be granted US$1,000 to pursue whichever educational field that they desire.</p>
<p>“They will also be provided access to financial hardship grants while they’re in school as well as business startup grants after graduation,” she added.</p>
<p>The application process involves applicants revealing the field of study being pursued such as artist management, medical assistant and even cannabis culinary.</p>
<p>The site also states that the scholarship is valid for only 30 days.</p>
<p>Previously, Ms Siew made headlines after announcing that she was shutting down her OnlyFans page to focus on her career in music as a DJ.</p>
<p>She has also ventured into acting, appearing in upcoming horror flick Pulau as well as KL Love Story.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Britain&#8217;s Opposition Labour Party is calling for a freeze on the money donated by an Indian rice tycoon to the governing Conservative Party while he is under investigation by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in India on fraud and money laundering allegations.</p>
<p>Karan Chanana, head of the global rice brand Amira, is being investigated by ED over claims that bank loans were unlawfully diverted into shell entities and is yet to respond to the allegations. He is believed to have donated around GBP 220,000 to the Conservatives through his British company Amira G. Foods since September 2019.</p>
<p>Margaret Hodge, a senior Labour MP and chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Anti-Corruption and Responsible Tax, told the &#8216;Guardian&#8217; newspaper on Saturday that the Tories should establish the source of these funds and freeze the money until the inquiries are completed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Tories have been too dependent on major donors and have not been doing proper checks. They should now be forced to do so by new legislation,&#8221; she told the newspaper.</p>
<p>It comes after reports from Delhi revealed that the ED conducted search operations on May 2 at 21 locations in India connected to Chanana, the Indian company Amira Pure Foods and other parties under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Charges are yet to be filed in the case as the ED says further inquiries are continuing.</p>
<p>&#8220;Investigations revealed that the accused entities in connivance with each other as well as other related/unrelated entities have illegally diverted loan funds sanctioned by the consortium of banks by way of transferring loan funds into the accounts of various shell entities under the guise of genuine business transactions,&#8221; the newspaper quoted an ED statement as saying.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was also known that Karan A Chanana had donated to a political party of [the] United Kingdom since 2019… while the accused entity had itself defaulted on repayment loans,&#8221; the statement adds.</p>
<p>Amira Nature Foods was listed on the New York stock exchange in October 2012, specialising in Indian basmati rice grown in the foothills of the Himalayas. Chanana, its chairman and chief executive, operated the business from its headquarters in the Gold Tower in Dubai, while its official company registration was in the British Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>The probe in India follows a consortium of banks headed by Canara Bank filing a report with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in November 2020 alleging bank fraud.</p>
